### Hi there I am Harshal  ðŸ‘‹
I showcase some of my projects here.  
I currently study Computer Vision at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.  

My current research topics include GANs, Transformers and modern CNNs. My aim is to create efficient models which can be easily deployed in real life. I have expertise in the full flow of DL application creation from R&D, POC, data creation/cleaning, testing and deployment. I have worked as a Deep Learning Engineer for almost 3 years before starting my Masters.
